# Redux Thunk Set Up

Courtesy of Art, this project provides instructions on how to set up redux with thunk.

To get started, open index.js in the src folder. At the bottom of the file, follow the instructions (marked as comments). 

When you need to move to another file, the `// GOTO: ...` will tell you where to move. If that file and/or folder doesn't exist, create it.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). If you want to do a walk through, you can use create-react-app and delete the extra stuff prior to beginning the tutorial.
